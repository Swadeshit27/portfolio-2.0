# Overview
**Portfolio website** is a personal online platform where I showcase my skills, work experience, achievements, and contacts. A well-designed portfolio website allows visitors to easily explore the creator's work, learn about their background, and understand their expertise.

This is a full-stack application built with **Next.js** on the front-end and **Appwrite** as the backend service, delivering a high-performance, SEO-friendly experience. To ensure smooth and engaging user interactions, **Framer Motion** is used for animations, offering a polished and modern look. The application also features a robust admin panel that allows seamless management and updating of content, ensuring the platform stays current and scalable. This project highlights the perfect blend of dynamic functionality, user-friendly design, and cutting-edge technology.
